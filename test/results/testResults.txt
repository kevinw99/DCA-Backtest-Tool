lower buying threshold to 8, 5?  -> should see more buys
enable consecutive incremental buy -> should reduce period of buysing with small gaps

Actually once you control the buy and sell, then the whole algo is adjusted.

Similar to claude code use command line interface, can we skip the traditional UI, and use command line interface to
run the DCA algorithm. e.g, if I want to run the DCA algorithm batch, I can use the following command:
run TSLA batch, focus on parameter profitRequirement, gridIntervalPercent, trailingBuyActivationPercent,

Then the program already knows what is the best paramter for single run so far, and it will select a parameters to
tweek, and make sure not to produce too many combinations, and only use sensible ones. User does not consider those
. Just focus on the intent (what) and let AI figure out the how.

Instead of me runing a batch mode with all combinations, which is too many, and not efficient. I want you to take a
 heuristic approach to tweek the parameters based on the past results. So it is not brute force, but more like a guided
 search. So it is more efficient, and effective.
1. the program starts with a known best parameter set, and then it will try to tweek one parameter
depending on the results. e.g.
http://localhost:3000/backtest?mode=single&symbol=TDOC&startDate=2021-09-01&endDate=2025-10-02&strategyMode=long&lotSizeUsd=10000&maxLots=10&maxLotsToSell=1&gridIntervalPercent=10&profitRequirement=10&trailingBuyActivationPercent=10&trailingBuyReboundPercent=0&trailingSellActivationPercent=10&trailingSellPullbackPercent=5&source=batch
2. it should detect that perhaps the profitRequirement is too high, so there is no sells to get out of the some of
the positions to take some short term profits.
3. it identify the most critical parameters that affect the trading behavior, and then it will tweek them one at a time, and
see how it affects the results. It will not try all combinations, but only one at a time. As more individual tests are done, it will
learn better about the parameters, and it has more results to find critical parameters to tune.
To do that,,
1. First you  need to have a basic understand the how each parameter affects the trading behavior and result, the
along
the
tuing process, you learn more, and you should keep adding your learning to the knowledge base, so you can make
better decision next time.
2.So please document what you understand each parameters currenlty. Let's focus on long strategy first.

1.great, please create a KT document to capture the above understanding. then we can use it to guide the tuning
process and be ready for adding more learning as you go along.

2.Now I want you to devleop the requirements/design/tasks for implementing the above heuristic tuning process.
You can check exmaples under .kior and create a new spec foc. You
can create a new endpoint and a new UI page to support this. Once I click a button, it will start the tuning
process.
3. First it will shows the best known config it learn so far from other symbol, and the steps how it going to take
to tune. Very much like an how an AI agent (like you, codex) plan its steps.
4. then it will start the tuning process, and show the progress.
I can see
which configuration is currently being tested, and the results. I can see your reasoning on what to choose the next
configuration to test... the above specifics are just some ideas to get you started. don;t be limited by them. You
can
come up
with a better and
complete design.
5. As you tune, you will learn more about the parameters and their impact on the results. Please keep adding to the
 KT document
 4. when you see the results to converge, you don't see much improvement, you can stop the tuning process. I can
 also stop it.

Actaully I have more fundamental question. Can you implemnet this as an AI agent by itself? can you implemnt using
reinforcement learning? or the tuning process itself is a reinforcement learning process? I am not sure how to
describe the rquest, so help me articulate it
