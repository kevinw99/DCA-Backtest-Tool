This project evolved and has 3 parts:
1. stock data fetcher and db builder, also technical indicator calculator
2. backtest engine for DCA with trailing stop loss
3. front end to display stock chart with buy/sell markers and technical indicators

Can you organize the requirements so far? make each spec numbered and with sub sections if needed.
you did not copy the requirements doc. they are in the old project.

This project probably have some git issues. In intellij project view, I can't even see directory backend and
frontend, even though I can see them in finder.

I like to start with a new project but with all useful code copied over. Can you help me to do that?



1. can find a stock api provider that provides historical daily stock data for free

2. let's make sure the algorithm is correct, we can do a backtest on TSLA  from 2021-11-01 to 2023-11-01

3. the idea is that I can run backtest in command line by  cd /Users/kweng/AI/Stocks
                                                            node backtest_dca_optimized.js, or by UI, and they
                                                            should give the same result given I take the defult
                                                            parameters. However in UI got what is the in the screen
                                                             shot.


                                                            can you compare the reuslt and fix the problem.

should we precalculate the technical indicator and add to db or calcualte them on the fly

can you add a front end to
1 allow enter the back test info:
 // --- Strategy Parameters ---
 const SYMBOL = 'TSLA';
 const START_DATE = '2021-11-01';
 const END_DATE = '2023-11-01';
 const LOT_SIZE_USD = 10000;
 const MAX_LOTS = 5;
 const GRID_INTERVAL_PERCENT = 0.10;
 const REMAINING_LOTS_LOSS_TOLERANCE = 0.05;

2 plot the stock chart for the backtest period with buy and sell markers
3. please plot the technical indicators used in the backtest on the chart, pleaes add preceeding time period to the start date to allow for indicator calculation
4. please plot the complete price chart for all available data in the db with ability to zoom in to the backtest period

it says "No chart data available" when I select "All available data"

## Data Format
```json
{
  "date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "open": number,
  "high": number,
