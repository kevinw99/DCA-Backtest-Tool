Similar to claude code use command line interface, can we skip the traditional UI, and use command line interface to
run the DCA algorithm. e.g, if I want to run the DCA algorithm batch, I can use the following command:
run TSLA batch, focus on parameter profitRequirement, gridIntervalPercent, trailingBuyActivationPercent,

Then the program already knows what is the best paramter for single run so far, and it will select a parameters to
tweek, and make sure not to produce too many combinations, and only use sensible ones. User does not consider those
. Just focus on the intent (what) and let AI figure out the how.

even smarter, the program starts with a known best parameter set, and then it will try to tweek one parameter
depending on the results. e.g.
http://localhost:3000/backtest?mode=single&symbol=TDOC&startDate=2021-09-01&endDate=2025-10-02&strategyMode=long&lotSizeUsd=10000&maxLots=10&maxLotsToSell=1&gridIntervalPercent=10&profitRequirement=10&trailingBuyActivationPercent=10&trailingBuyReboundPercent=0&trailingSellActivationPercent=10&trailingSellPullbackPercent=5&source=batch
it should detect that perhaps the profitRequirement is too hight, so there is no sells to get out of the some of
the positions to take some short term profits.
how ask AI to come up with a heuristic way to tweek the parameters based on the results
AI needs to understand the how each parameter affects the trading behavior,
So ask AI how it understand the parameters, and how it will tweek them based on the results

--allowedTools, --allowed-tools <tools...>        Comma or space-separated list of tool names to allow (e.g.

--permission-mode <mode>                          Permission mode to use for the session (choices:
                                                    "acceptEdits", "bypassPermissions", "default", "plan")
   --dangerously-skip-permissions                    Bypass all permission checks. Recommended only for sandboxes

Since I make request on a ad-hoc basis, there seem to be quick solutino that incur technical debts. I need you to
thoroughly review existing code base to to see if there is any technical debt, and refactor the code base to remove
 duplication, and improve the code quality. make a new spec on how you can review the code base, and how to refactor it.

1. let's set the "End Date" in the parameter default to use the latest date. User can still change it. This
requires fetching the latest date from the data source, please just request the missing quote, and keep older quote
 in the db, otherwise any data outside the 5 years window will be lost if you make a full refresh, correct?
 2.  what is
the current
cache duration?

try grid size, grid size can be incremental
sell activation can be incremental

differnet activation
try selling activation =0

1. in batch mode, there is no display of beta? it should be the same as in single mode, there is beta display.
2 when enable "Enable Beta-based Parameter Scaling", I select coefficient=0.25,0.5 , the URL is:

http://localhost:3000/batch?mode=batch&profitRequirement=0&gridIntervalPercent=10&trailingBuyActivationPercent=10%2C5&trailingBuyReboundPercent=0&trailingSellActivationPercent=0&trailingSellPullbackPercent=0%2C5&coefficients=0.25%2C0.5&enableBetaScaling=true
3. results are non zero, which is good.  however,

get the latest quote
output pending order, current price, current lots held
how to save various lot price, or is it only the average matter?
